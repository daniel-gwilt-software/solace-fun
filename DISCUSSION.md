If I had more time to work on this project I would add:
* pagination to the back-end and the front-end.  
  *   Front-end table support for pagination.  This is built in feature of Material Design MUI
  *   Back-end searching and filtering to be handled by the DB
* Unit tests and End to End tests via Jest.
* Prettier to standardise
* Better visualization of the specialities.  
* Sorting of table items by column
